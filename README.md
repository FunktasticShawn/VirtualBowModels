# VirtualBowModels

These models are intended to provide an acceptable starting point for various design types.  All models have been developed to experience similar peak stresses both at full draw and during release.  All models use the same material, length, draw weight, handle shape, arrow and string masses, and simulation settings.

## Using the models

Wood has a tremendous variation in mechanical properties from tree to tree within given species.  With that in mind the specific thickness values in these models are based on "typical" values for the species.  It is usually a good idea to allow plenty of extra material during rough out (between 1/16" and 3/16").

The main thing to take from these models is how the curvature is distributed along the limb.  Using a tillering gizmo, or 8-10" straight edge, you can see where the most bend is in your bow, and work on stiff areas compared to the bend in the model.  

## Contributions
The starting point models target a draw weight of 34 pounds, are 870 mm long, 50 mm at the widest point, with a draw length of 730 mm (28.5 inches).  These specifications are intended to represent a very acheivable bow for a relative beginner.

Other designs are welcome, but maybe we would have an advanced folder or something?  Something to deal with when the time comes I guess.
